# SpaKnit: correlation subspace learning for integrating spatial multi-omics data

> This repository contains the essential materials for reproducing the results of **SpaKnit**.

## Description

SpaKnit is a multimodal integration framework for spatial multi-omics data. SpaKnit treats different omics modalities as continuous functions defined by their shared spatial coordinates, enabling it to uncover nonlinear correlations among these modalities.
