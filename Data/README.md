## &#9889;Simulated Data Generation Strategies

&#x1F4A7;**Simulated Dataset 1: Spatial Patterns of Varying Complexity.**

**Four spatial distribution patterns** were generated Inspired by the work of Yang, P. et al<sup>1</sup>, assigning spatial coordinates to 300 spots per cell type: 

(1) Quadrant Pattern: a simple spatial distribution with well-separated regions; 

(2) Stripe Pattern: a moderate spatial complexity with gradual transitions between regions, forming stripe-like patterns; 

(3) Arc Pattern: a more intricate spatial pattern with gradual transitions between regions, exhibiting curved patterns; 

(4) Layered Pattern: the most complex spatial structure, characterized by concentric, progressively changing regions.

The specific generation process of the above simulated dataset see [Simulated Dataset 1](Simulated_Dataset_1_Generation.ipynb).

&#128293;**Simulated Dataset 2: Different Noise Levels and Combinations.**

**Four different noise combinations** were designed by adding Gaussian noise and pepper noise (“dropout” events). The four combinations were generated by applying two types of noise to modalities in all possible arrangements. Three noise levels were applied to both modalities. The coordinates generated by the arc spatial pattern are used as the spatial information across noise combinations.
